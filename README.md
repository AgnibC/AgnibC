Hello there,
I am Agnibrata, a recent MBA graduate in marketing and finance, now transitioning into data analysis. I have developed proficiency in SQL for data querying, Excel for data manipulation and visualization, and PowerBI for creating interactive dashboards. Currently, I am working on various projects that apply these skills to real-world business problems. I am looking to combine my understanding of businesses with insights from data to drive value to stakeholders. I am midway through my learning journey and am open to internships and junior roles in this field.
Happy exploring
